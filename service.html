                Taha Medical Center is one of the pioneers in modern Dental Health Care in the country. We have one of the largest and most modern dental clinics in the Northern Emirates.

                 Preventive dentistry helps one in taking very good care of the teeth and in properly managing oral health. This helps in reducing future complications and costs associated with restorative dental care which becomes necessitated when teeth and oral health are not properly taken care of. Besides regular brushing, flossing, and use of fluorides regular visits to a dentist at least twice a year is recommended. This will help in carrying out professional dental cleaning (prophylaxis – removal of dental plaque and stains) and undergoing screenings. Screenings are oral examination of the gums and teeth. These help in early detection of oral problems, go in for X-rays if needed and help dentist’s make treatment recommendations based on their findings. At our dental center our facilities include a 3-D Panoramic X-ray unit for carrying out whole mouth X-rays.

                Our experienced dental team specializes in providing comprehensive dental care and treatment for chronic dental diseases/ conditions such that these are not only arrested but their harmful effects are reversed. At Orthodontics we correct bad bite (malocclusion) which can impair eating and speaking and hard to clean cooked tooth through the use of dental braces and clear teeth aligners – invisible braces.

                Our specialized services include cosmetic dentistry and we are well equipped to carry out teeth whitening as well as provide dental veneers, crowns, and implants to improve the cosmetic appearance of your teeth. The differences between veneers, crowns, and implants is the area of the tooth which each option covers. While dental veneers mainly cover the front of a tooth, the crowns by contrast cover the entire tooth, including the front, back, and the sides. As a result, crowns are used to repair broken teeth, including teeth that have little structure left. Crowns can also help to strengthen the teeth they cover.

                    Tooth extraction is a quick outpatient procedure which is generally carried out with either local or general anesthesia. These procedures which are performed by a dentist or an oral surgeon are of two types – simple extraction (removing of visible teeth) and surgical extraction (removal of teeth which are broken or below the gum surface).

                    While some adults have their wisdom teeth removed by extraction a medical need to have this done can arise due to reasons such as excessive tooth decay, infection, crowding of teeth and teeth that fail to erupt on their own. Removing of a teeth or two has also to be performed for persons who are going in for braces as space needs to be provided for teeth to shift into place.

                    Dental Filling is a treatment carried out to arrest tooth decay when the tooth becomes hollow on account of decay or physical injury. A filling of gap arrests further decay and also serves as a protection to arrest further development of the cavity. Filling is also used to repair broken or cracked tooth and teeth which wear off due to poor dental habits like teeth grinding, nail biting etc. Dental filling is also carried out as a treatment for filling single or multiple cavities and for treating sensitivity that arises when hot or cold food or beverage is being consumed. When fillings are not in time the infection can travel down to the nerve and eventually damage the tooth resulting in a need to carry out an RCT. It also poses the risk of the infection traveling to the adjacent tooth making it prone to decay.

                    There are various types of Dental filling and the type of filling used will depend on various factors such as personal preferences, condition of decay and aesthetic needs.

                    The various types of filling available are – metal filling, amalgam filling, composite filling and porcelain/ ceramic filling.

                    Is carried out by an endodontist or a general dentist to remove bacteria from the infected part of the tooth to eliminate pain as well as to treat seriously decayed and fractured teeth. If not treated in time these issues can lead to the loss of the infected tooth and spread of infection to the neighboring tooth as well. Alternatives to RCT are the removal of the infected tooth and replacing it with dental implant/ bridge or a removable partial denture which happens to be costly or inconvenient.

                    RCT is usually carried out in one/ two visits (additional visits may be required for some tooth which are difficult to treat or fractured) after which the provision of crown on the treated tooth is provided when opted for by the patient. Procedures involved here are determining the extent of damage or infection through an X-Ray, administering local anesthesia to control/ reduce pain while carrying out the treatment, and finally the removal of decay from the pulp chamber using small dental instruments. Access to the pulp chamber is obtained by making an opening through the crown. The term root canal is used because the procedures involved here are cleaning the canals of the tooth.

                    In addition to RCT being carried out for treatment of decayed teeth with pain or for treatment of fractured teeth it is also carried out as a treatment for discolored and disfigured teeth, cosmetic reshaping and beatification of teeth as well as for full mouth rehabilitation.

                    In addition to regular tooth brushing and flossing which helps in removal of plaque periodic professional cleaning by a dentist or dental hygienist using metal hand held instruments helps in removal of tartar (hardened plaque) that builds up on the teeth. Cleaning of teeth is followed by polishing to remove plaque and stains on the tooth surface. This is carried out using an abrasive substance and fluoride and is applied on the teeth in small rotating motions.
                    
                    This generally safe and common procedure helps to remove bacteria, prevent tooth decay, and also serve as an early treatment for periodontal diseases and advanced gingivitis.

                     Restoration of dentition is required not only to improve personal appearances but also to help chew food. While dental implants are used to replace lost tooth there are other alternatives such as dental bridges,
                      flexible partial dentures, full sets of upper or lower artificial teeth, single arch denture and cosmetic artificial teeth. Based on your age and personal preferences the dental team at Taha Medical Center can help you decide which is the right option for you.

                    Orthodontic treatment is a way of straightening or moving teeth. Besides improving teeth 
                    appearance and looks it also aids in improving the long-term health of teeth, gums and jaw 
                    joints, by spreading the biting pressure over all your teeth. When teeth are misaligned and 
                    dental conditions such as crowded teeth, cross bite, overbite, under bite and open bite result
                    in ‘Malocclusion’ – teeth will not be able to perform its vital functions such as chewing of
                     food but oral and digestive health could also be at risk. Our dental professionals can typically 
                     correct malocclusion of teeth in children and adults. Receiving early dental treatment in childhood
                      can help reduce the treatment duration and may lead to fewer dental expenses in the long run.

                    Dental Implants are an amazing option for those who have lost their teeth due to an injury or periodontal disease. Here an 
                    artificial tooth root is placed into the jaw and is used as a substitute for the original tooth roots. It hence offers a near-permanent solution to 
                    replace lost teeth and can provide a natural look that can last for decades.

                    Dental implants are bone like structures which are attached by the dentists to the jawbone to secure a crown in the mouth
                     as a replacement for the missing teeth. This procedure is carried out when a tooth becomes irreparable on account of it being badly broken 
                     and hence requires removal. There are two main types of dental implants used to replace one or more teeth i.e. endosteal and periosteal. In consultation with the patient the dentist at TMC will determine the procedure to be carried out.

                        </h3>
                        We understand that smile is the medium through which a person expresses his emotions. An aesthetic smile not only enhances an individual’s 
                        self-confidence but also contributes to one’s success in life and work. Several choices are now available to the one’s who aspire to improve
                         their smiles. Improving the aesthetics of a person’s smile begins with the evaluation and analysis of both Facial and Dental Composition.
                          The evaluation and analysis of facial composition start with the alignment, symmetry, and proportion of the face, while aspects related to
                           the Dental Midline, Incisal Edges, Tooth Dimensions, Zenith Points, Axial Inclinations, Interdental Contact Area(ICA), and Interdental Contact Point (ICP)
                            are looked at for Dental evaluation. This is carried out through imaging and oral examination and forms the basis for case analysis and discussions. 
                            Post evaluation a one-on-one discussion with patients is carried out to understand their needs and expectation as well as to finalize the treatment options.
                             On a case-to-case basis treatment and procedures that need to be undertaken would vary and involves aspects such as orthodontics, orthognathic surgery, 
                             periodontal surgery, cosmetic dentistry, oral surgery, and plastic surgery. The strong commitment of our medical practitioners backed by their education, 
                             experience, and expertise helps us provide  patients with the ideal smile they aspire for.

                        Dental veneers are thin custom-made shells that are placed on the front of an individual’s teeth. They offer a long-term solution to cosmetic
                         tooth problems as they hide stained, chipped and uneven teeth and thus improve teeth appearance.

                        Veneers come in two different types and vary in both cost and durability. Porcelain veneers last longer are generally strong but are more costlier than Resin-based 
                        composite veneers which are more affordable than the former but can break more easily.

                        This is a popular cosmetic dentistry treatment that improves the whiteness of one’s teeth and enhance the smile. ‘Whitening’ restores a tooth
                         to its natural colour by removing dirt and debris. When teeth are whitened beyond its natural colour by using products containing bleach i.e,
                          hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide the term ‘bleaching’ is also used. Teeth whitening is totally risk free and bleaching is considered to
                           be safe when carried out under the medical advice of our Dental Team. For information, we would like to disclose that risks associated with bleaching 
                           are temporary sensitivity, gum irritation for about a week and technicolor teeth arising from use of veneers or dental bonds.

                        As opposed to normal dental treatment which makes use of metallic dental 
                        instruments like file, drills etc., LASER (acronym for – light amplification
                         by the stimulated emission of radiation) treatment makes use of an instrument
                          that emits light energy in a very narrow and focused beam for carrying out
                           the procedures which makes the treatment comfortable as well as reduces the
                            chance for infection. Laser light produces a reaction when it hits the tissue,
                             allowing it to remove or shape it. Laser dentistry is currently used in a 
                             variety of procedures for treating hypersensitivity, treating tooth decay,
                              treating gum disease and teeth whitening. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
                               has in 1990 approved the use of laser therapy for treatment of Intraoral Gingival and Mucosal Tissue Surgery.
